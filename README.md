# GalaxyQuest

In our game Galaxy Quest, we, an astronaut, are stuck in space because our mothership is malfunctioning. To fix it, we need to go on one hell of an interstellar scavenger hunt to try and find the ship parts, which are scattered around the galaxy. You explore different planets and moons to find these parts. Along the way, you will find plenty of hints for your hunt. You have a small space pod to travel between the mothership and the planets and moons. Once you have gathered all the needed parts, you can put your spaceship back together and make a successful escape from space adventure.
